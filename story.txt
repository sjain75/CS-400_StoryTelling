Once upon a time, there was a student at a prestigious university. His name was "Master Procrastinator". Just like his name suggests, he was excellent at procrastinating. Just like many other procrastinators he used to delay doing his work, however, his reasons were different. His reason was that he liked the rush, that made him feel like every assignment was like a hackathon where everything always fails in the last hour yet magically starts working in the last few moments before the deadline. However, this time he was in a team project, and he may have bugged his teammates with his procrastination and he felt bad about it.

This method that he worked on may have worked for individual assignments, but the method started to stress out the other teammates because they did not have the same thinking.
Finding this out shocked the Master Procrastinator and made him rethink how group projects will work the rest of the semester :).

He didn't even let one of the group members post their part on his story before he finished it!.

In the future, the Master Proscrastinator will be on top of his work for his group projects.
He will communicate clearly with his teammates and will not wait to do things until the last minute.
