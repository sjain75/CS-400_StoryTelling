Once upon a time, there was a student at a prestigious university. His name was "Master Procrastinator". Just like his name suggests, he was excellent at procrastinating. Just like many other procrastinators he used to delay doing his work, however, his reasons were different. His reason was that he liked the rush, that made him feel like every assignment was like a hackathon where everything always fails in the last hour yet magically starts working in the last few moments before the deadline. However, this time he was in a team project, and he may have bugged his teammates with his procrastination and he felt bad about it.
